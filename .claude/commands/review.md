I have a state machine implementation project with three key files:

1. **state-machine/state-machine.md**: This file defines a complete state machine for an AI Engineer workflow orchestration system. It contains all states, spells (commands), and transition rules that define how the system should behave. This is the specification document that defines what should be implemented.

2. **state-machine/implementation-plan.md**: This file contains the technical architecture and design decisions for implementing the state machine. It includes TypeScript interfaces, types, and the overall approach for building the system. This is our blueprint for the actual code implementation.

3. **state-machine/review.md**: This file contains feedback and suggested improvements for both the state machine specification and the implementation plan. It highlights specific areas that need to be addressed, modified, or enhanced in either document before we proceed with the implementation.

Your task is to:
1. Understand the state machine specification in the state-machine.md file
2. Understand the implementation plan in the implementation-plan.md file
3. Apply the feedback and suggestions from review.md to improve both the state machine design and the implementation plan as needed

Please analyze these files and provide:
1. Any suggested updates to the state machine specification based on the review
2. An updated implementation plan that incorporates all relevant feedback

Focus on maintaining a coherent system design while enhancing both the conceptual state machine and the technical implementation approach based on the review feedback.
