# Plan Creation Guide

## Purpose

This guide helps create effective project plans.

## Structure

- Start with clear summary
- Define testable acceptance criteria
- Outline technical approach
- Keep it focused and actionable

## Best Practices

- Make acceptance criteria specific and measurable
- Break down complex work into phases
- Consider dependencies and risks
- **All external dependencies must specify versions** (e.g., "React ^18.2.0", not just "React")

## External Dependencies

When listing external dependencies, always include specific version requirements:

- ✅ Good: "typescript": "^5.0.0"
- ❌ Bad: "typescript": "latest"
- ✅ Good: Node.js 18+ required
- ❌ Bad: Node.js required
