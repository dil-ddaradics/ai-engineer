# Task: Preserve Original State Machine Responses

## Introduction

You are working with an AI Engineer workflow orchestration system defined in a state machine document. This document (`state-machine.md`) contains a complete specification of states, transitions, and responses for a workflow system that helps engineers plan and execute tasks.

## File Location

The state machine is defined in the file located at:
`/Users/ddaradics/IdeaProjects/ai-engineer/state-machine/state-machine.md`

## Background

The state machine document defines:
- States that the system can be in
- Spells (commands) that users can cast to transition between states
- Transition rules that determine what happens for each state-spell combination
- Response messages that should be shown to users

## Your Task

Your task is to modify the transition tables in the state machine document to preserve the original responses before they are reformatted. This ensures we don't lose any information during the reformatting process.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Read the entire `state-machine.md` file to understand its structure.

2. For each transition table in the document:
   - Add a new column header called "Old Response" after the "Action" column and before the "Response" column
   - Copy the current content from the "Response" column to this new "Old Response" column
   - Keep the original "Response" column empty or with placeholder text (it will be reformatted in a later step)

3. The updated table structure should look like this:

Original:
```
| ID | Current State | Trigger | Condition | Next State | Action | Response |
|----|---------------|---------|-----------|------------|--------|----------|
| G1 | GATHER_NEEDS_PLAN | Accio | - | GATHER_EDITING | Create `.ai/task/plan.md` from template | Guide user in filling out sections, especially Acceptance Criteria |
```

New:
```
| ID | Current State | Trigger | Condition | Next State | Action | Old Response | Response |
|----|---------------|---------|-----------|------------|--------|-------------|----------|
| G1 | GATHER_NEEDS_PLAN | Accio | - | GATHER_EDITING | Create `.ai/task/plan.md` from template | Guide user in filling out sections, especially Acceptance Criteria | [New formatted response will go here] |
```

4. Apply this modification to ALL transition tables in the document. These tables appear in sections with headings like:
   - "Gather Acceptance Criteria Phase Transitions"
   - "Gather Acceptance Criteria Phase Blocked Transitions"
   - "Achieve Acceptance Criteria Phase Transitions"
   - And many more throughout the document

5. Ensure that all original Response content is preserved exactly as it appears in the Old Response column.

6. Save the updated document, maintaining all other content exactly as it is.

## Important Notes

- Do not modify any other columns or content in the document
- Preserve all formatting, including code blocks and markdown syntax
- Make sure to process ALL tables in the document
- The goal is simply to add a new column and copy the existing response text

This task is the first step in a process to standardize the response format for all state transitions.
