**AI Engineer Workflow** helps you work together with AI on any coding task. This system was built to teach effective collaboration with AI through a guided workflow. You can create plans, break them down into smaller tasks, get information from Jira and Confluence, and improve your code by handling PR comments.

For best results, commit your changes often and start new conversations to clear the AI's context when needed. Don't worry about losing progress - this system remembers where you left off!

**Key Concepts:**

- **Plans**: Define what you want to accomplish with acceptance criteria
- **Tasks**: Break plans into small, focused work sessions
- **Reviews**: Handle PR feedback systematically
- **Spells**: Commands to navigate the workflow (Accio, Expecto, Reparo, etc.)
