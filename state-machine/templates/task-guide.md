# Task Creation Guide

## Purpose
This guide helps create focused, actionable tasks.

## Structure  
- Clear objective linked to acceptance criteria
- Step-by-step implementation plan
- **Verification section that tests what was accomplished (mandatory)**

## Best Practices
- Keep tasks small and completable in one session
- Focus on one acceptance criterion at a time
- Each task should have steps and a verification section
- **The verification section is mandatory and must be run immediately after all steps are completed**

## Global Verification Steps
Add project-specific verification steps that should be run after every task:

**Example global steps to include in each task:**
- [ ] Run `npm run build` and ensure no build errors
- [ ] Run `npm run test` and ensure all tests pass  
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and fix any linting issues
- [ ]
