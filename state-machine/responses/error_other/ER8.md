Explain to the developer that Expecto is only allowed in GATHER states and they need to resolve the current error first with Accio.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
You attempted to cast **Expecto** which cannot be used right now because it's only allowed in GATHER states, and you're currently in an error state related to review tasks.

### Where We Are
We're in an error state with missing review task files that need to be resolved before normal workflow operations can continue.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Resolve the current error by recreating the missing review task file(s)
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** first to recreate the missing review task file(s). Once that's done, if you need to use Expecto, you'll need to exit the PR review process completely (with Accio to archive or Reverto to cancel) and return to the GATHER state.
