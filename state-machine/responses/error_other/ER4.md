## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Reverto** which cannot be used right now because it's only available in PR review states, and you're currently in an error state.

### Where We Are

We're in an error state that needs to be resolved before you can proceed with normal workflow operations.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Resolve the current error and recreate the missing file(s)
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing (if available in this error state)
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

First resolve the current error with **Accio** to recreate the missing file(s), then you'll be able to use the normal workflow commands.
