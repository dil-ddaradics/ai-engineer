Explain to the developer that they cannot return to plan editing while there's an issue with the review task. Direct them to use Accio to fix the missing review task first.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
You attempted to cast **Finite** which cannot be used right now because there's an issue with the review task that needs to be resolved first.

### Where We Are
We're currently in an error state because a review task file is missing or incomplete. This file is needed to proceed with the PR review workflow.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Recreate the missing review task file
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to recreate the `.ai/task/review task.md` file first. This will allow you to either continue with the review process or properly exit it.
