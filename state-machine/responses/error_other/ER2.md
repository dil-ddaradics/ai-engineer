## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Finite** which cannot be used right now because there's an issue with the review task that needs to be resolved first.

### Where We Are

We're currently in an error state because a review task file is missing or incomplete. This file is needed to proceed with the PR review workflow.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Recreate the missing review task file
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to recreate the `.ai/task/review task.md` file first. This will allow you to either continue with the review process or properly exit it.
