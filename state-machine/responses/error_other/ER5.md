## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Finite** which cannot be used right now because you should resolve the current error state first.

### Where We Are

We're in an error state due to a missing file that needs to be recreated before you can continue with normal workflow operations.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Fix the missing file issue and restore proper workflow state
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to fix the missing file issue first. This will recreate the necessary file and restore your workflow to a proper state, after which you can use Finite if you still want to return to plan editing.
