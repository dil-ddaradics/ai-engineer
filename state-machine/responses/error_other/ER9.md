## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
You attempted to cast **Finite** which cannot be used right now because there's no context file to return to.

### Where We Are
We're in an error state because the expected context file is missing.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Create the context document to start gathering project information
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to create your context document first, then you'll be able to use other spells to manage your workflow.
