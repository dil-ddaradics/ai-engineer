### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Reparo** which cannot be used right now because you need to resolve the current error state first.

### Where We Are

We're in an error state that needs to be fixed before you can start a PR review process.

- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** first to resolve the current error. This will recreate the missing file(s) and restore your workflow to a proper state, after which you can use Reparo to start a PR review if needed.
