## Response to the AI

Explain to the developer that Expecto is only allowed in GATHER states and they need to resolve the current error first with Accio or Finite.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Expecto** which cannot be used right now because it's only allowed in GATHER states, and you're currently in an error state.

### Where We Are

We're in an error state that needs to be resolved before you can use Expecto to enrich your plan with Atlassian resources.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Resolve the current error by recreating the missing file(s)
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

First use **Accio** to fix the current error by recreating the missing file(s). Once resolved, you can use Finite to return to plan editing if needed, and then use Expecto to enrich your plan with Atlassian resources.
