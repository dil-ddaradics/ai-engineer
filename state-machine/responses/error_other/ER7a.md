## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Expecto** which cannot be used right now because there's no plan file to enrich with Atlassian resources.

### Where We Are

We're in an error state due to a missing plan file, which is the core document that defines your project's goals and acceptance criteria.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Create a new plan file to start fresh
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** first to create a new plan file. Once you have a plan file with Atlassian URLs, you can use Expecto to enrich it with content from those resources.
