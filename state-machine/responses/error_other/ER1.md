## Response to the AI

Inform the developer that they cannot return to plan editing without a plan file. Direct them to use Accio to create a new plan file first.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Finite** which cannot be used right now because there is no plan file to return to.

### Where We Are

We're currently in an error state because the `.ai/task/plan.md` file is missing. This is the core document that defines your project's goals and acceptance criteria.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Create a new plan file and start fresh
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to create a new plan file first. This will reset the workflow and allow you to start defining your project goals and acceptance criteria.
