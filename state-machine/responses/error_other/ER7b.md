## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
You attempted to cast **Expecto** which cannot be used right now because you need to archive your current review results first.

### Where We Are
We've completed a PR review task and need to archive the results before we can return to a GATHER state where Expecto is available.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Archive the current review results and return to your previous workflow
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to archive your current review results first. This will return you to a GATHER state where you can then use Expecto to enrich your plan with Atlassian resources.
