## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Reparo** which cannot be used right now because there's a missing context file error that needs to be resolved first.

### Where We Are

We're in an error state because the expected context file is missing.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Create the context document to resolve the error
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** first to create the missing context file and resolve the error, then you can use **Reparo** to start a PR review.
