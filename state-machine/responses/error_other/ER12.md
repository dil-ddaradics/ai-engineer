## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Expecto** which cannot be used right now because there's no context file to enrich with Atlassian resources.

### Where We Are

We're in an error state because the expected context file is missing.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Create the context document to resolve the error
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** first to create the missing context file and resolve the error. Once you have a context file with Atlassian URLs, you can use **Expecto** to enrich it.
