## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Finite** which cannot be used right now because you need to complete your current task integration first.

### Where We Are

We're currently in the `.ai/task/task.md` file execution phase with results that need to be integrated into the `.ai/task/plan.md` file.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Process the task results and integrate them into the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to integrate your completed task results with the plan before returning to plan editing. This ensures your progress is properly tracked and the next task is set up correctly.
