## Response to the AI

Inform the developer that Expecto is only allowed in GATHER states because it's designed to enrich planning information from external resources. Explain that they need to return to plan editing first before using Expecto.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
You attempted to cast **Expecto** which cannot be used right now because it's only available during the planning phase.

### Where We Are
We're currently in the task implementation phase where we're working on completing acceptance criteria, not gathering information for planning.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Move forward with task execution or integration
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use **Finite** to return to plan editing first, then you can use **Expecto** to enhance your plan with Atlassian resources. This maintains the proper workflow sequence.
