### What Just Happened
You attempted to continue with the PR review task, but the review task file (`.ai/task/review-task.md`) is missing.

### Where We Are
We're in an error state because the review task file that should contain the specific tasks to address PR comments is not available.

### Available Spells

- **Reverto**: Exit the PR review process and return to your previous workflow
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use Accio to create a new review task based on the PR comments, or if you want to restart the PR review process from the beginning, use Reverto to cancel the current review.
