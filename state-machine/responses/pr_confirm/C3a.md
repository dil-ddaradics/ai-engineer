## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I've canceled the PR review restart and will continue using the existing PR comments from `.ai/task/comments.md`.

### Where We Are

We're back in the PR review flow with your existing comments file, ready to process the feedback that was previously gathered.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Process these PR comments and create tasks to address them
- **Reverto**: Exit the PR review process and return to your previous workflow
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Let's review the existing PR comments and use Accio to create tasks that address this feedback.
