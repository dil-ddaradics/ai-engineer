## Response to the AI

Read the existing `.ai/task/comments.md` file that was preserved when the user chose to continue with the current PR review process instead of restarting it.

Then, analyze the comments and prepare to help the user address them by:
1. Summarizing the main feedback points from the `.ai/task/comments.md` file
2. Identifying the key areas that need attention
3. Preparing to guide the user through addressing these comments
