## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I've canceled the PR review restart and will continue with your existing review task in `.ai/task/review-task.md`.

### Where We Are

We're back in the PR review task phase with your previously created review tasks, ready to implement the changes needed to address PR comments.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Execute the review task and implement the changes
- **Reverto**: Exit the PR review process and return to your previous workflow
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Let's review the existing PR review task and use Accio to implement the changes needed to address the feedback.
