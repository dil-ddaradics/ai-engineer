## Response to the AI

Read the existing `.ai/task/review-task.md` file that was preserved when the user chose to continue with the current PR review task instead of restarting it.

Then:

1. Review the tasks that were previously defined to address PR comments
2. Prepare to guide the user through implementing these tasks
3. Be ready to execute these tasks when the user casts Accio

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I've canceled the PR review restart and will continue with your existing review task in `.ai/task/review-task.md`.

### Where We Are

We're back in the PR review task phase with your previously created review tasks, ready to implement the changes needed to address PR comments.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Execute the review task and implement the changes
- **Reverto**: Exit the PR review process and return to your previous workflow
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Let's review the existing PR review task and use Accio to implement the changes needed to address the feedback.
