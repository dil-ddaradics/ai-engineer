## MANDATORY ACTION FOR AI

**EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY:**
1. Read the fresh `.ai/task/comments.md` file created after clearing previous review files
2. Check if GitHub MCP is available by examining your available tools/functions for GitHub-related capabilities
3. Test GitHub MCP with a minimal call (simple repository search) and analyze the response
4. Based on GitHub MCP availability, either fetch PR comments for current branch or guide user through setup
5. If PR comments exist: format and write them to `.ai/task/comments.md` with feedback summary
6. If no PR/comments found: document this explicitly in `.ai/task/comments.md` with explanation
7. **DELIVERABLE**: Fresh `.ai/task/comments.md` file with PR comment analysis starting from clean state
