## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Finite** which cannot be used right now because you need to create your context document first.

### Where We Are

We're at the very beginning of the workflow where no context has been created yet.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Create the context document to start gathering task information
- **Expecto**: Enrich with Atlassian resources (after creating context)
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to create your context document where you'll describe your task goals and requirements. Once you have a plan, you'll be able to use **Finite** to return to plan editing.
