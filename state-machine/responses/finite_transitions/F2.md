## Response to the AI

Read the `.ai/task/plan.md` file to understand what the user was working on. Note that all acceptance criteria in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file have been completed. Guide the user on what they can do next, such as adding new acceptance criteria or starting a PR review.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
We've returned to plan editing after completing all acceptance criteria in our project plan!

### Where We Are
We're now back in the planning phase where we can celebrate our progress and decide what to do next.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Progress to task creation once you've defined at least one new acceptance criterion
- **Expecto**: Enrich the plan with information from Atlassian resources if you have Jira or Confluence links
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Congratulations on completing all acceptance criteria! You can now:
1. Add new acceptance criteria to `.ai/task/plan.md` if you want to continue development
2. Use Reparo to start a PR review process for the work completed
3. Review the `.ai/task/plan.md` file to see everything that was accomplished
