## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
We've returned to the plan editing state from another workflow phase.

### Where We Are
We're now back in the planning phase where we can edit and refine our project plan.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Progress to task creation once you've defined at least one acceptance criterion
- **Expecto**: Enrich the plan with information from Atlassian resources if you have Jira or Confluence links
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Let's review and refine the plan in `.ai/task/plan.md`, making sure we have clear acceptance criteria defined before moving forward.
