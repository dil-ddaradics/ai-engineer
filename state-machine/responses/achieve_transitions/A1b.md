## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
I've encountered an error: the `.ai/task/task.md` file is missing from the workspace.

### Where We Are
We're in an error state where the system expected to find a task file but couldn't locate it.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Create a new task file based on the plan
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use Accio to create a new task file based on your plan, or use Finite to return to plan editing if you'd prefer to review the `.ai/task/plan.md` file first.
