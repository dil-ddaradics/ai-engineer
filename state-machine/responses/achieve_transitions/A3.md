## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

All acceptance criteria in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file have been completed!

### Where We Are

We've successfully completed all the acceptance criteria defined in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file.

### Available Spells

- **Finite**: Return to plan editing to add more acceptance criteria if needed
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process to get feedback on our implementation
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

You can use Finite to return to plan editing and add more acceptance criteria if the project requires additional work, or use Reparo to initiate a PR review process for the completed work.
