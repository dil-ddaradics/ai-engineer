## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
I've encountered an error: the task-results.md file is missing, which contains the results of your task execution.

### Where We Are
We're in an error state where the system expected to find task results but couldn't locate the file.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Request recreation of the task results based on current changes
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use Accio to have me recreate the task-results.md file based on the current git diff, or use Finite to return to plan editing.
