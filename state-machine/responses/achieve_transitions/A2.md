## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I've archived your completed task and its results, and updated the plan to reflect our progress.

### Where We Are

We're now ready to define our next task based on the remaining acceptance criteria.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Execute the newly created task
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Review the proposed next task I've created at `.ai/task/task.md`, modify it if needed. You can also check the `.ai/task-guide.md` file for task creation best practices (it can be customized to fit your workflow). Use Accio to execute it when you're ready.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Consider using Ask/Plan mode in your AI assistant to iterate on this file without accidentally executing the next step. Most AI agents like Cursor or Claude Code have a mode where they cannot edit files, which is useful for planning and refining content collaboratively before proceeding.
