## MANDATORY ACTION FOR AI

**EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY:**

1. Read the empty `.ai/task/comments.md` file to understand the context
2. Check if GitHub MCP is available by examining your available tools/functions for GitHub-related capabilities
3. Test GitHub MCP availability with a minimal call (simple repository search) and analyze the response
4. Based on GitHub MCP availability, either fetch PR comments for current branch or guide user through setup
5. If PR comments exist: format and write them to `.ai/task/comments.md` with feedback summary
6. If no PR/comments found: document this explicitly in `.ai/task/comments.md` with explanation
7. **DELIVERABLE**: Updated `.ai/task/comments.md` file with PR comment analysis or documentation of no comments found
