## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
I've created a new plan template at `.ai/task/plan.md` since your previous plan file was missing.

### Where We Are
We're starting fresh in the planning phase where we'll define what we want to accomplish.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Move to task creation after adding at least one acceptance criterion
- **Expecto**: Enrich our plan with information from Atlassian resources
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Let's fill out this plan at `.ai/task/plan.md` with our project goals and at least one specific acceptance criterion, then use Accio to start creating tasks.
