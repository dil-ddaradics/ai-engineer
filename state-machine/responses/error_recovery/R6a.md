Read the `.ai/task/comments.md` file to understand the PR feedback. Fill out the review task template in `.ai/task/review-task.md` that has been created by the system. The review task should include:
1. A summary of the PR comments
2. Specific tasks to address each comment
3. Acceptance criteria for those tasks
