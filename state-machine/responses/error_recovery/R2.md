## Response to the AI

Read the `.ai/task/task-results.md` file to understand what was completed in the previous task. Update `.ai/task/plan.md` to mark any completed acceptance criteria based on these results. Then create a new task in `.ai/task/task.md` focusing on the next uncompleted acceptance criterion. Note that the previous `.ai/task/task.md` and `.ai/task/task-results.md` have been archived to [ARCHIVE_PATH_PLACEHOLDER].

### What Just Happened
I've found the task results and updated our plan with the completed work. The previous task has been archived to [ARCHIVE_PATH_PLACEHOLDER] and a new task has been created at `.ai/task/task.md`.

### Where We Are
We're now drafting a new task in `.ai/task/task.md` based on the results of the previous work.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Execute this task and document the results
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing if you need to modify the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Let's review this new task in `.ai/task/task.md` and make any necessary adjustments before executing it with Accio.
