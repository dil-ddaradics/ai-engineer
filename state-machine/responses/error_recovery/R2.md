## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I've found the task results and updated our plan with the completed work. The previous task has been archived to [ARCHIVE_PATH_PLACEHOLDER] and a new task has been created at `.ai/task/task.md`.

### Where We Are

We're now drafting a new task in `.ai/task/task.md` based on the results of the previous work.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Execute this task and document the results
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing if you need to modify the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Let's review this new task in `.ai/task/task.md` and make any necessary adjustments. You can also check the `.ai/task-guide.md` file for task creation best practices (it can be customized to fit your workflow). Use Accio to execute it when ready.
