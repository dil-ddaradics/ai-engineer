Inform the developer that both the review task file and comments file are missing. They need to recreate the comments.md file first.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
I attempted to create a review task, but couldn't find the PR comments file that's needed as a reference.

### Where We Are
We're in an error state where both the PR comments and review task are missing.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Recreate the comments file first to gather PR comments
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use Accio to recreate the comments.md file first, which will gather your PR comments. Once we have the comments, we can create a review task.
