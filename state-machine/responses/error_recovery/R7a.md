## Response to the AI

Inform the developer that both the `.ai/task/review task.md` file and comments file are missing. They need to recreate the `.ai/task/comments.md` file first.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
I attempted to create a review task, but couldn't find the PR comments file that's needed as a reference.

### Where We Are
We're in an error state where both the PR comments and review task are missing.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Recreate the `.ai/task/comments.md` file first to gather PR comments
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use Accio to recreate the `.ai/task/comments.md` file first, which will gather your PR comments. Once we have the comments, we can create a review task.
