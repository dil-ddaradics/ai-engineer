## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

We've recreated the missing context document and restored the context editing phase.

### Where We Are

We're back in the context editing phase where you can provide your project information.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Generate a structured plan once you've added content to context.md
- **Expecto**: Enrich context with information from Atlassian resources
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Finite**: No-op (already in context editing)
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Please add your project context, goals, requirements, and any relevant information to the `.ai/task/context.md` file. Then use **Accio** to generate your structured plan when ready.
