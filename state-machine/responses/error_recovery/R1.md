## Response to the AI

Read the `.ai/task/plan.md` file to understand the project goals and acceptance criteria. Use the template in `.ai/task/task.md` that the MCP has created for you to propose a new task based on the next uncompleted acceptance criterion in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file. Use the `.ai/task-guide.md` file for task creation guidance.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
I've created a new task file at `.ai/task/task.md` since the previous one was missing.

### Where We Are
We're now back in the `.ai/task/task.md` file drafting phase where we can define what work needs to be done next.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Execute this task and document the results
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing if you need to modify the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process 
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Let's complete the task definition in `.ai/task/task.md` with clear steps. You can also check the `.ai/task-guide.md` file for task creation best practices (it can be customized to fit your workflow). Use Accio to execute it when ready.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Consider using Ask/Plan mode in your AI assistant to iterate on this file without accidentally executing the next step. Most AI agents like Cursor or Claude Code have a mode where they cannot edit files, which is useful for planning and refining content collaboratively before proceeding.
