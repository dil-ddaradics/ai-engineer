## Response to the AI

Read the `.ai/task/plan.md` file to identify uncompleted acceptance criteria. Fill out the task template in `.ai/task/task.md` focusing on the next uncompleted acceptance criterion. Use the `.ai/task-guide.md` file for task creation guidance. The previous incomplete task has been archived to [INCOMPLETE_ARCHIVE_PATH_PLACEHOLDER].

### What Just Happened

I've archived the incomplete task to [INCOMPLETE_ARCHIVE_PATH_PLACEHOLDER] and filled out the new task template at `.ai/task/task.md` since the previous task results file was missing.

### Where We Are

We're back in the `.ai/task/task.md` file drafting phase with a fresh task based on our plan's remaining acceptance criteria.
