## MANDATORY ACTION FOR AI

**EXECUTE IMMEDIATELY:**
1. Read the `.ai/task/plan.md` file to identify uncompleted acceptance criteria
2. Read the existing `.ai/task/task.md` file to understand the template format
3. Fill out the task template focusing on the next uncompleted acceptance criterion
4. Use the `.ai/task-guide.md` file for task creation guidance
5. **DELIVERABLE**: Completed task file following existing template format based on remaining acceptance criteria

Note: The previous incomplete task has been archived to [INCOMPLETE_ARCHIVE_PATH_PLACEHOLDER].

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I've archived the incomplete task to [INCOMPLETE_ARCHIVE_PATH_PLACEHOLDER] and filled out the new task template at `.ai/task/task.md` since the previous task results file was missing.

### Where We Are

We're back in the `.ai/task/task.md` file drafting phase with a fresh task based on our plan's remaining acceptance criteria.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Execute this task and document the results
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing if you need to modify the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Let's review the `.ai/task/task.md` file and make any necessary adjustments. You can also check the `.ai/task-guide.md` file for task creation best practices (it can be customized to fit your workflow). Use Accio to execute it when ready.
