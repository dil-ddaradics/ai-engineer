# Changes Made to Handle Archived Files

## Problem Addressed
We identified an issue where transition responses were instructing the AI to read files that were being archived in the same transition, which would make them unavailable by the time the AI was executing its instructions.

## Changes Made

### State-Machine.md Updates
1. **P3 Transition**: Updated Action column to load review-task-results.md content into memory before archiving the file
2. **P4a Transition**: Updated Action column to load review-task-results.md content into memory before archiving the file
3. **P4b Transition**: Updated Action column to load review-task-results.md content into memory before archiving the file

### Response File Updates
1. **P3.md**:
   - Modified instructions to use provided content instead of reading the file directly
   - Added a placeholder section for review task results: [REVIEW_TASK_RESULTS_PLACEHOLDER]

2. **P4a.md**:
   - Modified instructions to use provided content instead of reading the file directly
   - Added a placeholder section for review task results: [REVIEW_TASK_RESULTS_PLACEHOLDER]

3. **P4b.md**:
   - Modified instructions to use provided content instead of reading the file directly
   - Added a placeholder section for review task results: [REVIEW_TASK_RESULTS_PLACEHOLDER]

### Verification
- Confirmed that the A2 transition already correctly handled archived files with a placeholder
- Verified that the state machine remains complete and valid with 100% coverage
- Ensured consistency in how archived files are handled across all transitions
