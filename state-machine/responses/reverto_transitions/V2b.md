### What Just Happened

We've exited the PR review process and returned to your executed task and its results.

### Where We Are

We're in the `.ai/task/task.md` file completion phase where we've executed a task and documented the results. These results are ready for review and integration with the plan.

### Available Spells

### Next Steps

Let's review the `.ai/task/task.md` file results in `.ai/task/task-results.md`. When you're satisfied with the results, use Accio to process them, update the `.ai/task/plan.md` file, and determine what to tackle next.
