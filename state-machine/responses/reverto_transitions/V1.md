## Response to the AI

Read the `.ai/task/plan.md` file to understand what the user was working on before entering the PR review flow. Guide the user through continuing their work on the plan now that they've exited the PR review process.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
We've exited the PR review process and returned to plan editing.

### Where We Are
We're now back in the planning phase where we can edit and refine our project plan.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Progress to task creation once you've defined at least one acceptance criterion
- **Expecto**: Enrich the plan with information from Atlassian resources if you have Jira or Confluence links
- **Reparo**: Begin a new PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Let's return to working with the plan in `.ai/task/plan.md`. You can review and refine your acceptance criteria or use Accio to start creating tasks.
