## Response to the AI

Inform the developer that this action requires confirmation because it will discard the current `.ai/task/review-task.md` file which contains the specific tasks to address PR comments.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

A confirmation is needed: You've requested to restart the PR review process, but there are already defined review tasks in progress in `.ai/task/review-task.md` based on PR comments from `.ai/task/comments.md`.

### Where We Are

We're at a decision point where you need to choose whether to discard the current review tasks and restart the PR review process from the beginning.

### Available Choices

- **Reparo**: Confirm and restart the PR review process from gathering comments (will discard current review tasks)
- **Reverto**: Cancel and return to plan editing without restarting
- **Accio**: Continue with the existing review tasks without restarting

### Next Steps

Review both the existing PR comments in `.ai/task/comments.md` and the review tasks in `.ai/task/review-task.md` to help you decide. Then choose whether to proceed with restarting the PR review process or cancel it. Use **Reparo** to confirm the restart, **Reverto** to cancel and return to plan editing, or **Accio** to continue with the existing review tasks.
