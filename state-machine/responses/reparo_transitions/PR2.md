## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

A confirmation is needed: You've requested to restart the PR review process, but there's already an existing PR review in progress with comments stored in `.ai/task/comments.md`.

### Where We Are

We're at a decision point where you need to choose whether to restart the PR review process with fresh comments.

### Available Choices

- **Reparo**: Confirm and restart the PR review process with fresh comments (will overwrite existing comments)
- **Reverto**: Cancel and return to task drafting without restarting the PR review
- **Accio**: Continue with the existing PR comments without restarting

### Next Steps

Review the existing PR comments in `.ai/task/comments.md` to help you decide. Then choose whether to proceed with restarting the PR review process or cancel it. Use **Reparo** to confirm the restart, **Reverto** to cancel and return to task drafting, or **Accio** to continue with the existing comments.
