### Where We Are
You're in an error state because the PR review task results file is missing when you should have review task execution results. You entered the PR review from plan editing.

- `.ai/task/comments.md`: PR comments that were addressed
- `.ai/task/review-task.md`: The review task that was executed
- `.ai/task/review-task-results.md`: Missing - this is causing the error
