### Where We Are
You're in an error state because the PR review task results file is missing when you should have review task execution results. You entered the PR review from plan editing.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/comments.md`: PR comments that were addressed
- `.ai/task/review-task.md`: The review task that was executed
- `.ai/task/review-task-results.md`: Missing - this is causing the error

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Recovers from this error by returning to PR review task drafting to re-execute the task
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Finite**: Not available until the error is resolved. Finite would return you to plan editing, but you need to first recover from the error state using **Accio** to re-execute the review task.
- **Reparo**: Not available until the error is resolved. Reparo would initiate a new PR review process, but you need to first complete the current one by using **Accio**.
- **Reverto**: Not available in error states. Reverto would normally cancel the PR review process, but you need to first recover from the error state using **Accio**.
- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence), but you need to first complete the PR review and return to plan editing.

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to return to the review task drafting state so you can re-execute the task and generate the missing results.
