### Where We Are
You're in an error state because the task file is missing when you should be in task drafting.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/task.md`: Missing - this is causing the error

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Recovers from this error by creating a new task.md template
- **Finite**: Returns to plan editing
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reparo**: Not available until the error is resolved. Reparo would initiate a PR review process to gather PR comments, but you need to first recover from the error state using **Accio**.
- **Reverto**: Not available because you're not in a PR review workflow. Reverto is used to exit the PR review process and return to your previous workflow.
- **Expecto**: Not available during task execution phases. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence), but you first need to return to plan editing with **Finite**.

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to create a new task file and recover from this error, or use **Finite** to return to plan editing.
