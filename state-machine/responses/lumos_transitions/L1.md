### Where We Are
You are in the initial phase where planning hasn't started yet.

**Key Files:**
No project files exist yet.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Creates a new plan file (`.ai/task/plan.md`) and starts the planning process
- **Expecto**: Attempts to enrich plan information from Atlassian resources (requires an existing plan with Atlassian URLs)
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reparo**: Not available because PR review requires an existing plan. Reparo would normally initiate a PR review process to gather PR comments, but you need to create a plan first using **Accio**.
- **Reverto**: Not available because you're not in a PR review workflow. Reverto is used to exit the PR review process and return to your previous workflow.
- **Finite**: Not available because you're already in the initial state. Finite would normally return you to plan editing, but since no plan exists yet, it has no effect.

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to create a new plan file where you can define your project's acceptance criteria and goals.
