### Where We Are
You have completed all acceptance criteria in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file! All tasks have been successfully executed.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with all acceptance criteria checked off

### Available Spells
- **Finite**: Returns to plan editing so you can add more acceptance criteria
- **Reparo**: Initiates a PR review process to gather PR comments
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions
- **Accio**: Reminds you that all acceptance criteria are complete ;)

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reverto**: Not available because you're not in a PR review workflow. Reverto is used to exit the PR review process and return to your previous workflow, but you haven't started a PR review yet.
- **Expecto**: Not available during task execution phases. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence). Use **Finite** to return to plan editing first, and then you can use Expecto if you have Atlassian URLs in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file.

### Next Steps
Use **Finite** to return to plan editing and add more acceptance criteria if needed, or **Reparo** to start a PR review process.
