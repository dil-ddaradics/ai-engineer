### Where We Are
You have completed PR review tasks and need to archive the results before continuing. You entered the PR review from plan editing.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/comments.md`: PR comments that were addressed
- `.ai/task/review-task.md`: The review task that was executed
- `.ai/task/review-task-results.md`: Results from executing the review task

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Archives review results, updates the plan with a summary, and returns to plan editing
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Finite**: Not available until you archive the review results with Accio
- **Reparo**: Not available until you archive the current review results
- **Reverto**: Not available in this phase (must use Accio to complete the process)
- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review (only during planning)

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to archive your PR review results, update the plan with a summary of changes made, and return to plan editing.
