### Where We Are

You have completed PR review tasks and need to archive the results before continuing. You entered the PR review from plan editing.

**Key Files:**

- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/comments.md`: PR comments that were addressed
- `.ai/task/review-task.md`: The review task that was executed
- `.ai/task/review-task-results.md`: Results from executing the review task

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Archives review results, updates the plan with a summary, and returns to plan editing
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells

- **Finite**: Not available until you archive the review results with Accio. Finite would return you to plan editing, but you must first archive your PR review results to ensure your changes are properly integrated.
- **Reparo**: Not available until you archive the current review results. Reparo would initiate a new PR review process, but you need to complete the current one first by using **Accio** to archive the results.
- **Reverto**: Not available in this phase. Reverto would normally cancel the PR review process, but at this stage you've already completed the review work and must use **Accio** to properly save and archive your progress.
- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence), but you need to first archive your review results with **Accio** and return to plan editing.

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to archive your PR review results, update the `.ai/task/plan.md` file with a summary of changes made, and return to plan editing.
