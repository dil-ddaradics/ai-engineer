### Where We Are
You need to confirm whether to restart the PR comments gathering process. You were in task execution and requested to gather PR comments again while PR comments already exist.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/comments.md`: Existing PR comments that might be overwritten
- `.ai/task/task.md`: May exist if you were working on a task
- `.ai/task/task-results.md`: May exist if you completed a task

### Available Spells
- **Reparo**: Confirms restart - deletes existing comments and gathers new PR comments
- **Reverto**: Cancels restart - returns to task execution without gathering new comments
- **Accio**: Cancels restart - continues with existing PR comments without restarting
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Finite**: Not available during this confirmation step. Finite would return you to plan editing, but you must first resolve the confirmation request with either **Reparo** (confirm restart) or **Reverto** (cancel).
- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence), but you need to first resolve this confirmation step and return to plan editing.

### Next Steps
Choose whether to proceed with gathering new PR comments or cancel:
- Use **Reparo** to confirm and restart the PR comments gathering process
- Use **Reverto** to cancel and return to task execution
- Use **Accio** to cancel restart but continue with the existing PR comments
