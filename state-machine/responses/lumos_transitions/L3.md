### Where We Are
You are in the `.ai/task/task.md` file drafting phase where you define a specific task to achieve an acceptance criterion.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/task.md`: The task you're currently drafting
- `.ai/task-guide.md`: Task execution guidelines (can be customized)

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Executes the current task and documents results
- **Finite**: Returns to plan editing if you need to modify the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Reparo**: Initiates a PR review process to gather PR comments
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reverto**: Not available because you're not in a PR review workflow
- **Expecto**: Not available during task execution phases. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence). Use **Finite** to return to plan editing first, and then you can use Expecto if you have Atlassian URLs in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file.

### Next Steps
Review and refine the task in `.ai/task/task.md`, then use **Accio** to execute it when ready. If you need to adjust your plan first, use **Finite** to return to plan editing.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Consider using Ask/Plan mode in your AI assistant to iterate on this file without accidentally executing the next step. Most AI agents like Cursor or Claude Code have a mode where they cannot edit files, which is useful for planning and refining content collaboratively before proceeding.
