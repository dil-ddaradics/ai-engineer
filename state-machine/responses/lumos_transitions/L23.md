### Where We Are
We're in the context gathering phase where you're providing information about your project. You have a context file to work with but haven't generated a structured plan yet.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/context.md`: Contains your project information and requirements
- `.ai/plan-guide.md`: Contains planning guidelines and best practices

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Generate a structured plan from your context information
- **Expecto**: Enrich context with information from Atlassian resources
- **Finite**: Stay in context editing (no-op)
- **Lumos**: Show this current state information

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reparo**: Cannot start PR reviews until you have a plan (use **Accio** to create plan first)
- **Reverto**: Only available during PR review processes

### Next Steps
Continue editing your `.ai/task/context.md` file with project details, requirements, and any Jira/Confluence URLs. When ready, use **Accio** to generate your structured plan.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Consider using Ask/Plan mode in your AI assistant to iterate on this file without accidentally executing the next step. Most AI agents like Cursor or Claude Code have a mode where they cannot edit files, which is useful for planning and refining content collaboratively before proceeding.
