### Where We Are
You are in the plan editing phase where you define acceptance criteria and project goals.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Creates a task based on your plan if you have at least one acceptance criterion, or prompts you to add criteria if none exist
- **Expecto**: Enriches your plan with information from Atlassian resources (if you have Atlassian URLs in your plan)
- **Reparo**: Initiates a PR review process to gather PR comments
- **Finite**: Has no effect as you're already in plan editing phase
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reverto**: Not available because you're not in a PR review workflow. Reverto is used to exit the PR review process and return to your previous workflow, but you haven't started a PR review yet.

### Next Steps
Add at least one acceptance criterion to your plan and then use **Accio** to start creating tasks, or use **Expecto** if you have Atlassian links in your plan that you'd like to enrich with more information.
