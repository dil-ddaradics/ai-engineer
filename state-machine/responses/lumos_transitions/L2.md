### Where We Are

You are in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file editing phase where you define acceptance criteria and project goals.

**Key Files:**

- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Creates a task based on your plan if you have at least one acceptance criterion, or prompts you to add criteria if none exist
- **Expecto**: Enriches your plan with information from Atlassian resources (if you have Atlassian URLs in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file)
- **Reparo**: Initiates a PR review process to gather PR comments
- **Finite**: Has no effect as you're already in plan editing phase
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells

- **Reverto**: Not available because you're not in a PR review workflow. Reverto is used to exit the PR review process and return to your previous workflow, but you haven't started a PR review yet.

### Next Steps

Add at least one acceptance criterion to the `.ai/task/plan.md` file and then use **Accio** to start creating tasks, or use **Expecto** if you have Atlassian links in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file that you'd like to enrich with more information. Acceptance criteria are lines that start with `- [ ]` format, representing specific goals that need to be achieved (e.g., `- [ ] Create user dashboard`).

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Consider using Ask/Plan mode in your AI assistant to iterate on this file without accidentally executing the next step. Most AI agents like Cursor or Claude Code have a mode where they cannot edit files, which is useful for planning and refining content collaboratively before proceeding.
