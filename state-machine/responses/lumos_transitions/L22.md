### Where We Are

We're at the very beginning of your project workflow. No context has been created yet, so we need to start by gathering information about your project goals and requirements.

**Key Files:**

- `.ai/task/context.md`: Not created yet - this will contain your project information
- `.ai/plan-guide.md`: Not created yet - this will contain planning best practices

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Create the context document to start gathering task information
- **Lumos**: Show this current state information

### Unavailable Spells

- **Expecto**: Cannot enrich context without a context file (use **Accio** to create one first)
- **Reparo**: Cannot start PR reviews until you have a plan (use **Accio** to create plan first)
- **Finite**: Cannot return to plan editing because no plan exists yet
- **Reverto**: Only available during PR review processes

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to create your context document where you'll describe your project goals, requirements, and any relevant Jira or Confluence resources.
