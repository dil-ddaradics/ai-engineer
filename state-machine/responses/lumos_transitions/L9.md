### Where We Are
You are drafting tasks to address PR review comments after entering from task execution.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/comments.md`: PR comments that have been collected
- `.ai/task/review-task.md`: The review task being drafted
- `.ai/task/task.md`: May exist if you were working on a task
- `.ai/task/task-results.md`: May exist if you completed a task

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Executes the current review task and documents results
- **Finite**: Returns to plan editing while in the middle of PR review. Using this will leave the PR review process incomplete. Consider using **Accio** to complete the review or **Reverto** to properly cancel it first.
- **Reverto**: Cancels the PR review process and returns to task execution
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reparo**: Not available because you're already in a PR review workflow. Reparo is used to start a new PR review, but you're already in the middle of one. If you need to restart the PR review process, use **Reverto** to exit first, then **Reparo** to start again.
- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence), but you need to exit the PR review flow first with **Reverto** or **Finite**, then use Expecto during plan editing.

### Next Steps
Review and refine the tasks in `.ai/task/review-task.md`, then use **Accio** to execute them when ready. If you want to exit the PR review flow, use **Reverto**.
