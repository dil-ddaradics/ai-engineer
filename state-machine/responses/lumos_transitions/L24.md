### Where We Are

We're in an error state because the expected context file is missing. This usually happens if files were accidentally deleted or the system state became inconsistent.

**Key Files:**

- `.ai/task/context.md`: Missing - needs to be recreated
- `.ai/plan-guide.md`: May be missing - will be created if needed

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Recreate the context document and return to context editing
- **Lumos**: Show this current state information

### Unavailable Spells

- **Expecto**: Cannot enrich context without a context file
- **Reparo**: Cannot start PR review until error is resolved
- **Reverto**: Only available during PR review processes
- **Finite**: Cannot return to editing until context is recreated

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to recreate your context document and restore normal workflow functionality.
