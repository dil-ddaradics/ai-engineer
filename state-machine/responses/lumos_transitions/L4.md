### Where We Are
You are in the `.ai/task/task.md` file execution completion phase where a task has been executed and results are ready for review.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/task.md`: The task that has been executed
- `.ai/task/task-results.md`: Results from executing the task

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Archives current task results, updates the plan, and creates a new task
- **Reparo**: Initiates a PR review process to gather PR comments
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Finite**: Not available until you've processed your task results with Accio. Finite would normally allow you to return to plan editing, but you must first archive your task results using **Accio** to ensure your progress is properly integrated into the `.ai/task/plan.md` file.
- **Reverto**: Not available because you're not in a PR review workflow. Reverto is used to exit the PR review process and return to your previous workflow.
- **Expecto**: Not available during task execution phases. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence). You need to process your task results with **Accio** and then use **Finite** to return to plan editing before you can use Expecto.

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to archive your completed task, update the `.ai/task/plan.md` file with the results, and move on to the next task. This is required before you can return to plan editing.
