### Where We Are
You're in an error state because the PR comments file is missing when you're in the PR comments gathering phase. You entered the PR review from plan editing.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/comments.md`: Missing - this is causing the error

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Recovers from this error by creating a new comments.md and gathering PR comments
- **Finite**: Returns to plan editing, abandoning the PR review process
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reparo**: Not available until the error is resolved
- **Reverto**: Not available in error states
- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review (only during planning)

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to create a new comments.md file and gather PR comments, or use **Finite** to abandon the PR review and return to plan editing.
