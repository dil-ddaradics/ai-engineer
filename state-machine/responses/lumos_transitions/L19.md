### Where We Are
You're in an error state because the PR comments file is missing when you're in the PR comments gathering phase. You entered the PR review from plan editing.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/comments.md`: Missing - this is causing the error

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Recovers from this error by creating a new comments.md and gathering PR comments
- **Finite**: Returns to plan editing, abandoning the PR review process
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reparo**: Not available until the error is resolved. Reparo would initiate a new PR review process, but you're already in one with an error. Use **Accio** to recreate the comments file or **Finite** to exit the PR review process.
- **Reverto**: Not available in error states. Reverto would normally cancel the PR review process, but in this error state it's disabled for safety. Use **Accio** to recover or **Finite** to exit completely.
- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence), but you need to first exit the PR review flow with **Finite** and return to plan editing.

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to create a new comments.md file and gather PR comments, or use **Finite** to abandon the PR review and return to plan editing.
