### Where We Are
You are drafting tasks to address PR review comments after entering from plan editing.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/comments.md`: PR comments that have been collected
- `.ai/task/review-task.md`: The review task being drafted

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Executes the current review task and documents results
- **Finite**: Not recommended; you should first complete or cancel the PR review flow
- **Reverto**: Cancels the PR review process and returns to plan editing
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reparo**: Not available because you're already in a PR review workflow
- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review (only during planning)

### Next Steps
Review and refine the tasks in `.ai/task/review-task.md`, then use **Accio** to execute them when ready. If you want to exit the PR review flow, use **Reverto**.
