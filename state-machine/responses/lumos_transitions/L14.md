### Where We Are
You need to confirm whether to restart the entire PR review process from comments gathering. You were in plan editing and requested to gather PR comments again while a review task already exists.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/comments.md`: May exist if PR comments were gathered
- `.ai/task/review-task.md`: Existing review task that would be discarded

### Available Spells
- **Reparo**: Confirms restart - deletes existing review files and gathers new PR comments
- **Reverto**: Cancels restart - returns to plan editing without restarting
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Accio**: Not available during this confirmation step
- **Finite**: Not available during this confirmation step
- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review (only during planning)

### Next Steps
Choose whether to restart the PR review process or cancel:
- Use **Reparo** to confirm and restart the entire PR review process
- Use **Reverto** to cancel and return to plan editing
