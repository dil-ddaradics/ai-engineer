### Where We Are
You're in an error state because the PR review task file is missing when you're in the PR review task drafting phase. You entered the PR review from plan editing.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/comments.md`: PR comments that have been collected
- `.ai/task/review-task.md`: Missing - this is causing the error

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Recovers from this error by creating a new `.ai/task/review-task.md` template based on `.ai/task/comments.md`
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Finite**: Not available until the error is resolved. Finite would return you to plan editing, but you need to first recover from this error state by using **Accio** to create a new review task.
- **Reparo**: Not available until the error is resolved. Reparo would initiate a new PR review process, but you're already in one with an error. Use **Accio** to recreate the review task file first.
- **Reverto**: Not available in error states. Reverto would normally cancel the PR review process, but in this error state it's disabled for safety. Use **Accio** to recover first.
- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence), but you need to first complete or cancel the PR review process.

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to create a new review task file based on the PR comments and recover from this error.
