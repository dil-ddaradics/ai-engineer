### Where We Are
You're in an error state because the task results file is missing when you should have task execution results.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/task.md`: Your task definition
- `.ai/task/task-results.md`: Missing - this is causing the error

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Recovers from this error by either using existing results if found, or archiving the incomplete task and creating a new task
- **Finite**: Returns to plan editing
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reparo**: Not available until the error is resolved
- **Reverto**: Not available because you're not in a PR review workflow
- **Expecto**: Not available during task execution phases (only during planning)

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to recover from this error. If task-results.md exists elsewhere, it will be used; otherwise, the incomplete task will be archived and a new task created.
