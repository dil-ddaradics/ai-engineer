### Where We Are

You're in an error state because the `.ai/task/plan.md` file is missing when it's required for your current workflow.

**Key Files:**

- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Missing - this is causing the error

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Recovers from this error by creating a new `.ai/task/plan.md` template
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells

- **Finite**: Not available because there's no plan to return to. Finite would normally return you to plan editing, but since the plan is missing, there's nothing to edit.
- **Reparo**: Not available until the error is resolved. Reparo would initiate a PR review process to gather PR comments, but you need to first create a plan with **Accio**.
- **Reverto**: Not available because you're not in a PR review workflow. Reverto is used to exit the PR review process and return to your previous workflow.
- **Expecto**: Not available because there's no plan to enrich. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources, but you need to first create a plan with **Accio**.

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to create a new plan file and recover from this error.
