### Where We Are
You are in the PR review comments gathering phase after entering from plan editing.

**Key Files:**
- `.ai/task/plan.md`: Your project plan with acceptance criteria
- `.ai/task/comments.md`: PR comments collected

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Creates a review task based on the collected PR comments
- **Finite**: Returns to plan editing, canceling the PR review process
- **Reverto**: Cancels the PR review process and returns to plan editing
- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Reparo**: Not available because you're already in a PR review workflow. Reparo is used to start a new PR review, but you're already in the middle of one. If you need to restart the PR review process, use **Reverto** to exit first, then **Reparo** to start again.
- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence), but you need to exit the PR review flow first with **Reverto** or **Finite**, then use Expecto during plan editing.

### Next Steps
Review the comments in `.ai/task/comments.md`, then use **Accio** to create tasks to address these comments. If you want to exit the PR review flow, use **Reverto**.
