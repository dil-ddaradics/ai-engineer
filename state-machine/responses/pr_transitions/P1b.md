## Response to the AI

Inform the developer that the `.ai/task/comments.md` file is missing and explain how to recover using Accio to recreate the file.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
I tried to create review tasks, but the PR comments file is missing. This could happen if the file was accidentally deleted.

### Where We Are
We're in an error state where we need to recreate the comments file before proceeding with the PR review.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Recreate the comments file and gather PR comments again
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing (only if you want to abandon this PR review)
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use Accio to recreate the comments file and fetch PR comments again. This will return us to the comments gathering phase so we can continue with the PR review process.
