## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I tried to create review tasks, but the `.ai/task/comments.md` file is missing. This could happen if the file was accidentally deleted.

### Where We Are

We're in an error state where we need to recreate the `.ai/task/comments.md` file before proceeding with the PR review.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Recreate the `.ai/task/comments.md` file and gather PR comments again
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing (only if you want to abandon this PR review)
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use Accio to recreate the `.ai/task/comments.md` file and fetch PR comments again. This will return us to the `.ai/task/comments.md` file gathering phase so we can continue with the PR review process.
