## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I've analyzed your PR comments and created a structured task list to address the feedback.

### Where We Are

We're now in the PR review task drafting phase where we'll plan how to address each comment systematically.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Execute the review tasks to address the PR comments
- **Reverto**: Cancel this PR review process and return to previous workflow
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Review the tasks I've created in `.ai/task/review-task.md`, make any adjustments needed, then use Accio to execute them and apply the requested changes.

Most AI agents like Cursor or Claude Code have a mode where they cannot edit files, which is useful for planning and refining content collaboratively before proceeding.
