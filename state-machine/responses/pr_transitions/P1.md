## Response to the AI

Read the comments.md file containing PR comments and the review-task.md template file. The review-task.md template has a predefined structure - follow this structure to fill in tasks that address each PR comment.

For each comment in comments.md:
1. Analyze the comment to understand what changes are requested
2. Add a task to review-task.md following the template format
3. Include specific acceptance criteria for each task
