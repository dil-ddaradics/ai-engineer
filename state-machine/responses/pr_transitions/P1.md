## Response to the AI

Read the `.ai/task/comments.md` file containing PR comments and the `.ai/task/review-task.md` template file. The `.ai/task/review-task.md` template has a predefined structure - follow this structure to fill in tasks that address each PR comment.

For each comment in `.ai/task/comments.md`:
1. Analyze the comment to understand what changes are requested
2. Add a task to `.ai/task/review-task.md` following the template format
3. Include specific acceptance criteria for each task
