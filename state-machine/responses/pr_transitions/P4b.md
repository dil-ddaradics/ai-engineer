## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I've archived the PR review results, updated our plan, and created a new task to move us forward.

### Where We Are

We're now drafting a new task in `.ai/task/task.md` where we'll define the specific work to be done next.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Execute the defined task and document results
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing if we need to modify the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Reparo**: Begin a new PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Let's review and refine the proposed task I've created, then use Accio to execute it when we're ready.
