## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
I tried to archive the PR review results, but the `.ai/task/review-task-results.md` file is missing. This likely happened because the file was accidentally deleted or not properly created.

### Where We Are
We're in an error state where we need to recreate the `.ai/task/review task results.md` file before archiving and returning to your regular workflow.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Recreate the `.ai/task/review task results.md` file based on changes made
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use Accio to recreate the `.ai/task/review task results.md` file. I'll analyze the git diff to see what changes were made to address the PR comments and document them appropriately.
