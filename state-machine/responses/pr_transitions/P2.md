## Response to the AI

Read the `.ai/task/review-task.md` file to understand what tasks need to be performed to address the PR comments. Execute each task in the review task file:

1. Parse the task definitions from `.ai/task/review-task.md`
2. For each task:
   - Make the required code changes
   - Document what was changed and why
   - Verify the change addresses the PR comment
3. Document all results in `.ai/task/review-task-results.md`, including:
   - Summary of all changes made
   - Code snippets of before/after for each change
   - Any challenges encountered and how they were resolved
   - For any tasks that couldn't be completed, explain why
