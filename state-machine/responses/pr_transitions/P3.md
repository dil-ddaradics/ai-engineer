## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I've archived the PR review results and updated our plan with a summary of the changes made.

### Where We Are

We're back in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file editing phase where we can continue refining our acceptance criteria.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Move to task creation after adding at least one acceptance criterion
- **Expecto**: Enrich our plan with information from Atlassian resources
- **Reparo**: Begin a new PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Review the `.ai/task/plan.md` file updates I've made based on the PR feedback. You can continue editing the plan and when ready, use Accio to create a new task. If you need to add more acceptance criteria, remember they are lines that start with `- [ ]` format, representing specific goals that need to be achieved.
