## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
I've archived the PR review results and updated our plan with a summary of the changes made.

### Where We Are
We're back in the plan editing phase where we can continue refining our acceptance criteria.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Move to task creation after adding at least one acceptance criterion
- **Expecto**: Enrich our plan with information from Atlassian resources
- **Reparo**: Begin a new PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Review the plan updates I've made based on the PR feedback. You can continue editing the plan and when ready, use Accio to create a new task.
