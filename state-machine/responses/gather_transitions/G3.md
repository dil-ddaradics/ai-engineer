## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You cast **Accio** which had no effect because our plan doesn't have any acceptance criteria defined yet.

### Where We Are

We're still in the planning phase. Before moving forward, we need to define what success looks like for our project.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Try again after adding at least one acceptance criterion
- **Expecto**: Enrich our plan with information from Atlassian resources
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Let's add at least one acceptance criterion to our `.ai/task/plan.md` file, then use Accio again to proceed to task creation. Acceptance criteria are lines that start with `- [ ]` format, representing specific goals that need to be achieved (e.g., `- [ ] Implement user authentication`).
