## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I've detected that the `.ai/task/plan.md` file is missing, which is required for the current workflow.

### Where We Are

You're in an error state because the `.ai/task/plan.md` file that should contain your project requirements and acceptance criteria cannot be found.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Reset the workflow and create a new plan file
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to reset the workflow and create a new plan file where you can define your project requirements.
