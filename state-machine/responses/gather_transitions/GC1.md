## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
We've created a new context document where you can describe your task and requirements.

### Where We Are
We're now in the context gathering phase where you'll provide all the information about your task goals, requirements, and any relevant resources.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Generate a structured plan from your context information
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Expecto**: Cannot enrich context until you have content in your context file
- **Reparo**: Cannot start PR reviews until you have a plan (use **Accio** to create plan first)

### Next Steps
Please add your task context, goals, requirements, and any Jira/Confluence links to the `.ai/task/context.md` file. You can also review the `.ai/plan-guide.md` file to understand how your context will be structured into a plan. Then use **Accio** to generate your structured plan.
