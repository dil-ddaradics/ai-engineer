## Response to the AI

Read the `.ai/task/plan.md` and the `.ai/task/task.md` file. Your goal is to propose the next smallest task that will help fulfill the remaining Acceptance Criteria in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file and put it into the `.ai/task/task.md` file following its template. Use the `.ai/task-guide.md` file for task creation guidance.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

We've created a task document based on our plan's acceptance criteria.

### Where We Are

We're now drafting a task in `.ai/task/task.md` where we'll define the specific work to be done.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Execute the defined task and document results
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing if we need to modify the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Let's review and refine the proposed task in `.ai/task/task.md`. You can also check the `.ai/task-guide.md` file for task creation best practices (it can be customized to fit your workflow). Use Accio to execute the task when we're ready.

Most AI agents like Cursor or Claude Code have a mode where they cannot edit files, which is useful for planning and refining content collaboratively before proceeding.
