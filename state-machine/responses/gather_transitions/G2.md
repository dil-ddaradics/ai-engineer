## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

We've created a task document based on our plan's acceptance criteria.

### Where We Are

We're now drafting a task in `.ai/task/task.md` where we'll define the specific work to be done.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Execute the defined task and document results
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing if we need to modify the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Let's review and refine the proposed task in `.ai/task/task.md`. You can also check the `.ai/task-guide.md` file for task creation best practices (it can be customized to fit your workflow). Use Accio to execute the task when we're ready.

> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Consider using Ask/Plan mode in your AI assistant to iterate on this file without accidentally executing the next step. Most AI agents like Cursor or Claude Code have a mode where they cannot edit files, which is useful for planning and refining content collaboratively before proceeding.
