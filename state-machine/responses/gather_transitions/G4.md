### Where We Are

We're now drafting our previously created task in `.ai/task/task.md`.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Execute the defined task and document results
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing if we need to modify the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Let's continue refining this task, then use Accio to execute it when we're ready.
