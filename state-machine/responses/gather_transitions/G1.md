## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
We've created a new plan document for our project.

### Where We Are
We're now in the planning phase where we'll define what we want to accomplish.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Move to task creation after adding at least one acceptance criterion
- **Expecto**: Enrich our plan with information from Atlassian resources
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Let's add at least one acceptance criterion to the plan.md file, then use Accio to start creating tasks.
