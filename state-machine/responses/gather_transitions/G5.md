## Response to the AI

Read the empty `.ai/task/comments.md` file, and then:

1. Check if GitHub MCP is available using this approach:
   - Check your available tools/functions for GitHub-related capabilities (look for functions containing terms like "github", "gh", or "git" in their names or descriptions)
   - Try a minimal call such as a simple repository search using a generic term like "test" OR list the repositories the authenticated user can access
   - Analyze the response:
     * If you receive GitHub data, the integration is working and authenticated
     * If you receive an authentication error, the integration exists but requires authentication
     * If no GitHub tools/functions are available, the integration is not installed

2. Based on GitHub MCP availability:
   - If GitHub MCP is available: Fetch PR comments for the current branch
   - If GitHub MCP is not available: Guide the user through setting it up

3. If there are PR comments:
   - Format and write comments to `.ai/task/comments.md`
   - Provide a summary of the feedback
   - Use the "Comments Found" response to the developer

4. If no PR exists or no comments found:
   - Explicitly document this in `.ai/task/comments.md`
   - Explain to the user that no comments were found
   - Use the "No Comments Found" response to the developer
