## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You cast **Expecto** which had no effect because no Atlassian URLs (Jira or Confluence links) were found in your plan.

### Where We Are

We're in the planning phase, but there are no Atlassian resources to enrich from.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Move to task creation based on current plan content
- **Expecto**: Enrich plan with Atlassian resources (add URLs to plan.md first)
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing to modify your plan
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

If you have relevant Jira tickets or Confluence pages for your project, add those URLs to your `.ai/task/plan.md` file and try **Expecto** again. Otherwise, use **Accio** to proceed with task creation from your current plan.
