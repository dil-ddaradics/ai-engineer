## Response to the AI

Inform the developer that all Atlassian URLs in the plan.md file have already been processed and suggest editing .atlassian-refs to reprocess if needed.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You cast **Expecto** which had no effect because all Atlassian URLs in your plan have already been processed.

### Where We Are

We're in the planning phase with all available Atlassian resources already integrated.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Move to task creation based on your enriched plan
- **Expecto**: Re-enrich plan with Atlassian resources (edit .atlassian-refs to reprocess)
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Finite**: Return to plan editing to modify your plan
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Your plan already includes information from all referenced Atlassian resources. Use **Accio** to proceed with task creation. If you need to reprocess the Atlassian links, edit the `.ai/task/.atlassian-refs` file and try **Expecto** again.
