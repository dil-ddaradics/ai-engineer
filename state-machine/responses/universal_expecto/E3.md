## Response to the AI

Inform the developer that no Atlassian URLs were found in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file. The MCP has checked the `.ai/task/plan.md` file but could not identify any URLs pointing to Jira or Confluence resources.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

I checked for Atlassian URLs (Jira or Confluence links) in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file, but couldn't find any.

### Where We Are

We're still in the planning phase, but without any Atlassian resources to enrich our plan.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Progress to the next step (create plan or task based on your current state)
- **Expecto**: Will only work if you add Atlassian URLs to the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

If you want to enrich your plan with Jira or Confluence information:

1. Add URLs to Jira tickets or Confluence pages in your `.ai/task/plan.md` file
2. Use **Expecto** again to fetch and incorporate that information

Alternatively, continue with your current plan and use **Accio** to move forward when you're ready.
