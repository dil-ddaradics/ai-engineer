a ## Response to the AI

Inform the developer that all Atlassian URLs found in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file have already been processed. The MCP found Atlassian URLs but all of them were already present in the .ai/task/.atlassian-refs file, indicating they have been previously fetched and incorporated into the `.ai/task/plan.md` file.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
I checked for new Atlassian URLs in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file, but all the URLs have already been processed and their content incorporated into the `.ai/task/plan.md` file.

### Where We Are
We're still in the planning phase with all referenced Atlassian resources already enriched in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Progress to the next step (create plan or task based on your current state)
- **Expecto**: Will only work with new Atlassian URLs not previously processed
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
If you want to re-fetch information from specific Atlassian URLs:
1. Edit the `.ai/task/.atlassian-refs` file and remove the URLs you want to process again
2. Use **Expecto** again to re-fetch and incorporate that information

Alternatively, add new Atlassian URLs to your `.ai/task/plan.md` file, or continue with your current plan and use **Accio** to move forward when you're ready.
