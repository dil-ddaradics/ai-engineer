a ## Response to the AI

Inform the developer that all Atlassian URLs found in the plan.md file have already been processed. The MCP found Atlassian URLs but all of them were already present in the .ai/task/.atlassian-refs file, indicating they have been previously fetched and incorporated into the plan.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
I checked for new Atlassian URLs in our plan, but all the URLs have already been processed and their content incorporated into the plan.

### Where We Are
We're still in the planning phase with all referenced Atlassian resources already enriched in our plan.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Progress to the next step (create plan or task based on your current state)
- **Expecto**: Will only work with new Atlassian URLs not previously processed
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
If you want to re-fetch information from specific Atlassian URLs:
1. Edit the `.ai/task/.atlassian-refs` file and remove the URLs you want to process again
2. Use **Expecto** again to re-fetch and incorporate that information

Alternatively, add new Atlassian URLs to your plan.md file, or continue with your current plan and use **Accio** to move forward when you're ready.
