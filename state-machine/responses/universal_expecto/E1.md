## Response to the AI

You have been provided with a list of Atlassian URLs from the plan.md file that have not been processed yet:

[ATLASSIAN_URLS_PLACEHOLDER]

First, check if the Atlassian MCP is available using this approach:
1. Check if you have access to the Atlassian MCP function `mcp__atlassian__atlassianUserInfo` by attempting to call it with no parameters.
2. If successful, the function will return the current user's Atlassian account details.
3. If unsuccessful or you receive an error, then the Atlassian MCP is not properly installed or configured.

Based on Atlassian MCP availability:
- If Atlassian MCP is available:
  1. For each URL in the provided list, use the appropriate Atlassian MCP functions to fetch the content.
  2. Enrich the `.ai/task/plan.md` file with relevant information from these Atlassian resources.
  3. After successfully processing each URL, add it to the `.ai/task/.atlassian-refs` file (one URL per line).
  4. Use the "Atlassian Integration Available" response to the developer.

- If Atlassian MCP is not available:
  1. Add a note to the `.ai/task/plan.md` file explaining that Atlassian integration is not available.
  2. Use the "Atlassian Integration Unavailable" response to the developer.

## Response to the Developer

### Atlassian Integration Available Response:

### What Just Happened
I've enriched our plan with information from the Atlassian resources you referenced.

### Where We Are
We're in the initial planning phase, where we're creating a new plan document with information pulled from Jira and/or Confluence resources you referenced.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Create the plan document to start defining our project goals
- **Expecto**: Further enrich the plan with additional Atlassian resources (if more are referenced)
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Review the enriched information I've added to our plan from your Atlassian resources. Then use **Accio** to create the plan document when you're ready to start defining your project goals.

### Atlassian Integration Unavailable Response:

### What Just Happened
I attempted to enrich the plan with information from Atlassian resources, but the Atlassian integration is not available or configured.

### Where We Are
We're in the initial planning phase, but without access to the Atlassian integration to pull in additional information.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Create the plan document to start defining our project goals
- **Expecto**: Attempt to enrich the plan with Atlassian resources (requires configuration)
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
To enable Atlassian integration:
1. Ensure you have valid Atlassian credentials
2. Configure the Atlassian integration for this environment
3. Try the **Expecto** spell again once configured

Alternatively, you can continue without Atlassian integration by using **Accio** to create the plan document and manually adding your requirements.
