## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Reverto** which cannot be used right now because it's only available during PR review states.

### Where We Are

We're in the planning phase where we define project requirements and acceptance criteria.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Advance to task creation (requires at least one acceptance criterion)
- **Expecto**: Enrich our plan with information from Atlassian resources
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Continue working on your plan by adding acceptance criteria, then use **Accio** to move to task creation, or use **Reparo** if you want to start a PR review process.
