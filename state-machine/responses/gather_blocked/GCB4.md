## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Reparo** which cannot be used right now because PR reviews require a plan to return to.

### Where We Are

We're in the context editing phase where you have context information but haven't yet generated your structured plan.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Generate a structured plan from your context information
- **Expecto**: Enrich context with information from Atlassian resources
- **Finite**: Stay in context editing (no-op)
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells

- **Reparo**: Cannot start PR reviews until you have a plan (use **Accio** to create plan first)
- **Reverto**: Only available during PR review processes

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to generate your structured plan from your context information. Once you have a plan document, you'll be able to use **Reparo** to start PR reviews that can return to plan editing.
