## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
You attempted to cast **Expecto** which cannot be used right now because there's no context file to read Atlassian URLs from.

### Where We Are
We're at the very beginning where no context has been created yet.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Create the context document to start gathering task information
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Unavailable Spells
- **Expecto**: Cannot enrich context without a context file (use **Accio** to create one first)

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to create your context document first. Once you have a context file with Atlassian URLs, you'll be able to use **Expecto** to enrich it.
