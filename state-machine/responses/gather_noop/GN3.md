## Response to the AI

Inform the developer that casting Expecto had no effect because no Atlassian URLs were found in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
You cast **Expecto** which had no effect because no Atlassian URLs (Jira/Confluence) were found in the `.ai/task/plan.md` file.

### Where We Are
We're in the planning phase, but we need Atlassian resources to enrich the plan.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Advance to task creation (requires at least one acceptance criterion)
- **Expecto**: Will work once you add Jira or Confluence links to the `.ai/task/plan.md` file
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Add Jira or Confluence URLs to your `.ai/task/plan.md` file, then use **Expecto** again to enrich your plan with content from these resources.
