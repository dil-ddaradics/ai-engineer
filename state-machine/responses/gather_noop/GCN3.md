## Response to the AI

Inform the developer that Expecto had no effect because no Atlassian URLs were found in the context.md file.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You cast **Expecto** which had no effect because no Atlassian URLs (Jira or Confluence links) were found in your context.

### Where We Are

We're in the context gathering phase, but there are no Atlassian resources to enrich from.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Generate a structured plan from your current context information
- **Expecto**: Enrich context with Atlassian resources (add URLs to context.md first)
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

If you have Jira tickets or Confluence pages relevant to your project, add those URLs to your `.ai/task/context.md` file and try **Expecto** again. Otherwise, use **Accio** to generate your plan from the current context.
