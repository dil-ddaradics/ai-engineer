## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You cast **Finite** which had no effect because we're already in the initial state and no plan exists yet.

### Where We Are

We're at the starting point of the workflow where we need to create a plan.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Create a new plan document
- **Expecto**: Not useful until we have a plan with Atlassian references
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to create a new plan document and start defining your project requirements.
