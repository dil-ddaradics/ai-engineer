## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You cast **Finite** which had no effect because you need to create your context file first.

### Where We Are

We're at the very beginning, where no context has been created yet.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Create the context document to start gathering project information
- **Expecto**: Enrich with Atlassian resources (after creating context)
- **Reparo**: Begin a PR review process
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Use **Accio** to create your context document and start defining your project goals and requirements.
