## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
You attempted to cast **Expecto** which cannot be used right now because it's only available in GATHER states, and you're currently in the final stage of a PR review.

### Where We Are
We've completed a PR review task with results that need to be archived before moving to other workflow operations.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Archive the current review results and return to your previous workflow
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
Use **Accio** to archive the current review results first. This will properly store your work and return you to the main workflow where you can then use Expecto if needed.
