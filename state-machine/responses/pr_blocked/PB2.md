## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
You attempted to cast **Expecto** which cannot be used right now because it's only available in GATHER states, and you're currently in a PR review flow.

### Where We Are
We're in the PR review flow where we're processing PR comments. Expecto is used specifically for enriching plans with Atlassian resources, which isn't applicable in this context.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Continue with the PR review process
- **Reverto**: Exit the PR review flow and return to your previous workflow
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
If you need to use Expecto, first exit the PR review flow with **Reverto**. Then, once back in the GATHER state, you can use Expecto to enrich your plan with Atlassian resources.
