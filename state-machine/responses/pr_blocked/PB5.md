## Response to the AI

Tell the developer they must first confirm or cancel the restart operation using Reparo or Reverto before they can return to plan editing.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Finite** which cannot be used right now because you need to address the confirmation prompt first.

### Where We Are

We're at a confirmation point where you need to decide whether to restart the PR review process or not. This decision needs to be resolved before returning to plan editing.

### Available Spells

- **Reparo**: Confirm the restart operation
- **Reverto**: Cancel the restart operation
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

First resolve the confirmation prompt by either:

1. Using **Reparo** to confirm the restart operation, or
2. Using **Reverto** to cancel the restart operation

Once you've made your choice, you'll be returned to an appropriate state where you can use Finite if needed.
