## Response to the AI

Tell the developer they must either complete the PR review flow with Accio or exit it with Reverto before returning to plan editing.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
You attempted to cast **Finite** which cannot be used right now because you must first complete or exit the PR review flow.

### Where We Are
We're in the middle of a PR review process, which should either be completed or explicitly canceled before returning to plan editing.

### Available Spells
- **Accio**: Continue with the PR review process to completion
- **Reverto**: Exit the PR review flow and return to your previous workflow
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
You have two options:
1. Use **Accio** to continue processing the PR review to completion
2. Use **Reverto** to exit the PR review flow entirely and return to your previous workflow

Once you've either completed or exited the PR review flow, you can use Finite to return to plan editing if needed.
