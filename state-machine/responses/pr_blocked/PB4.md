## Response to the AI

Tell the developer they must complete the current PR review process or use Reverto to cancel it before starting a new PR review.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened

You attempted to cast **Reparo** which cannot be used right now because you're already in a PR review process.

### Where We Are

We're in the middle of a PR review workflow that needs to be either completed or canceled before starting a new PR review.

### Available Spells

- **Accio**: Continue with the current PR review process
- **Reverto**: Exit the current PR review flow and return to your previous workflow
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps

Either:

1. Use **Accio** to continue and complete the current PR review process, or
2. Use **Reverto** to cancel the current PR review and return to your previous workflow

Once you've completed or canceled the current PR review, you can use Reparo again to start a fresh PR review if needed.
