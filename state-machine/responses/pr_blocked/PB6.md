## Response to the AI

Explain to the developer that Expecto is only allowed in GATHER states and they need to resolve the current confirmation prompt first before they can return to plan editing and use Expecto.

## Response to the Developer

### What Just Happened
You attempted to cast **Expecto** which cannot be used right now because it's only available in GATHER states, and you're currently at a PR review confirmation prompt.

### Where We Are
We're at a confirmation point where you need to decide whether to restart the PR review process or not. This needs to be resolved before you can return to plan editing and use Expecto.

### Available Spells
- **Reparo**: Confirm the restart operation
- **Reverto**: Cancel the restart operation
- **Lumos**: Show current state and available actions

### Next Steps
First resolve the confirmation prompt by either:
1. Using **Reparo** to confirm the restart operation, or
2. Using **Reverto** to cancel the restart operation

After that, you can use Finite to return to plan editing, and then you can use Expecto to enhance your plan with Atlassian resources.
