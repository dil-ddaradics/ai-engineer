# Task: Implement Calculator Class

## Objective

Create a TypeScript Calculator class with basic arithmetic operations including proper error handling and input validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

This task works toward the following acceptance criteria from the plan:

- [ ] **AC**: Calculator class with add, subtract, multiply, divide methods
- [ ] **AC**: Handle division by zero with proper error handling

## Steps

1. [ ] Create src/Calculator.ts file
2. [ ] Implement Calculator class with proper TypeScript types
3. [ ] Add add(a: number, b: number): number method
4. [ ] Add subtract(a: number, b: number): number method
5. [ ] Add multiply(a: number, b: number): number method
6. [ ] Add divide(a: number, b: number): number method with division by zero handling
7. [ ] Add input validation for all methods

## Verification

This section is mandatory and must be run after all steps are completed:

- [ ] Calculator class exports properly
- [ ] All four arithmetic methods work correctly
- [ ] Division by zero throws appropriate error
- [ ] Input validation rejects non-number inputs
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Basic manual testing passes
