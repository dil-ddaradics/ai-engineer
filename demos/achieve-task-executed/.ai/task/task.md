# Task: Implement Calculator Class

## Objective

Create a TypeScript Calculator class with basic arithmetic operations including proper error handling and input validation.

## Acceptance Criteria

This task works toward the following acceptance criteria from the plan:

- [ ] **AC**: Calculator class with add, subtract, multiply, divide methods
- [ ] **AC**: Handle division by zero with proper error handling

## Steps

1. [x] Create src/Calculator.ts file
2. [x] Implement Calculator class with proper TypeScript types
3. [x] Add add(a: number, b: number): number method
4. [x] Add subtract(a: number, b: number): number method
5. [x] Add multiply(a: number, b: number): number method
6. [x] Add divide(a: number, b: number): number method with division by zero handling
7. [x] Add input validation for all methods

## Verification

This section is mandatory and must be run after all steps are completed:

- [x] Calculator class exports properly
- [x] All four arithmetic methods work correctly
- [x] Division by zero throws appropriate error
- [x] Input validation rejects non-number inputs
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] Basic manual testing passes
