**File**: `src/Calculator.ts`
**Line**: 28
**Comment**: The divide method should handle floating-point precision issues. Consider using a small epsilon for comparison instead of exact zero check.

**File**: `src/Calculator.ts`  
**Line**: 12
**Comment**: Input validation could be more robust. What happens if someone passes NaN or Infinity?

#### @typescript-expert (Review 2)

**File**: `src/Calculator.ts`
**Line**: 5
**Comment**: Consider making this class abstract or adding more specific method overloads for better type safety.

**File**: `src/Calculator.ts`
**Line**: 35
**Comment**: The error message for division by zero could be more descriptive. Maybe include the operands?

#### @qa-lead (Review 3)

**General Comment**: Good test coverage! A few suggestions:

- Add tests for edge cases like very large numbers
- Test floating-point precision edge cases
- Consider performance tests for bulk operations

**File**: `tests/Calculator.test.ts`
**Line**: 67
**Comment**: Missing test case for NaN inputs and Infinity handling.
