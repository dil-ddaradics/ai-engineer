# Review Task Results

## Summary

Successfully addressed all PR feedback to make the Calculator implementation production-ready. Enhanced precision handling, improved validation, and added comprehensive test coverage.

## Changes Made

- Enhanced floating-point precision handling with epsilon-based comparisons
- Extended input validation to handle NaN and Infinity values explicitly
- Improved error messages with more descriptive context and operand values
- Added comprehensive edge case tests for very large numbers and floating-point precision
- Enhanced TypeScript method signatures with better overloads
- Updated JSDoc documentation with detailed usage examples

## Comments Addressed

1. **Floating-point precision**: Implemented epsilon-based comparison for division results
2. **NaN/Infinity handling**: Added explicit validation with specific error messages
3. **Error messages**: Enhanced all error messages with context and operand details
4. **Test coverage**: Added 15+ new edge case tests while maintaining 100% coverage

## Problems Encountered

No significant issues encountered. All PR feedback was successfully addressed and code quality meets production standards. The Calculator class is now robust and handles all edge cases appropriately.
