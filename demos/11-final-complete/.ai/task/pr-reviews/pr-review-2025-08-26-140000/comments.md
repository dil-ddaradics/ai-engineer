# PR Review Comments

## Instructions

Feel free to delete any comments below that you don't want to address. Only keep comments that are relevant to you. For each comment you keep, write your response or action plan underneath it - the AI will use this to create the appropriate tasks.

Note: This tool will not respond to comments on GitHub for you - you are responsible for responding to reviewers directly on the platform.

## Comments

### Comment 1

**Comment**: The floating-point arithmetic could be more precise. Consider adding epsilon-based comparison for division results.

**Your Response/Action**: Will enhance division method with better floating-point precision handling and add epsilon-based comparisons where needed.

---

### Comment 2

**Comment**: Input validation should handle NaN and Infinity values more explicitly.

**Your Response/Action**: Will extend input validation to catch NaN and Infinity values and provide specific error messages for these edge cases.

---

### Comment 3

**Comment**: Error messages could be more descriptive, especially for division by zero.

**Your Response/Action**: Will improve error messages to include more context and operand values where appropriate.

---

### Comment 4

**Comment**: Test coverage is good but could benefit from edge cases like very large numbers and floating-point precision tests.

**Your Response/Action**: Will add comprehensive edge case tests including very large numbers and floating-point precision scenarios.

## Notes

Overall feedback is positive. The main focus should be on enhancing robustness and precision handling to make this production-ready.
