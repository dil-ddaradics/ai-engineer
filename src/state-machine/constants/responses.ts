Using this will leave the PR review process incomplete. Consider using **Accio** to complete the review or **Reverto** to properly cancel it first.\n- **Reverto**: Cancels the PR review process and returns to task execution\n- **Lumos**: Shows your current state and available actions\n\n### Unavailable Spells\n\n- **Reparo**: Not available because you're already in a PR review workflow. Reparo is used to start a new PR review, but you're already in the middle of one. If you need to restart the PR review process, use **Reverto** to exit first, then **Reparo** to start again.\n- **Expecto**: Not available during PR review. Expecto would enrich your plan with information from Atlassian resources (Jira and Confluence), but you need to exit the PR review flow first with **Reverto** or **Finite**, then use Expecto during plan editing.\n\n### Next Steps\n\nReview and refine the tasks in `.ai/task/review-task.md`, then use **Accio** to execute them when ready. If you want to exit the PR review flow, use **Reverto**.\n\n> **ðŸ’¡ Tip**: Consider using Ask/Plan mode in your AI assistant to iterate on this file without accidentally executing the next step.
